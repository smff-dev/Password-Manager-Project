## Setup
To get the password manager ready for use, run initialise.py. This will generate the key for encryption. If you run it more than once it will make any passwords previously entered impossible to decrypt.

Once initialise.py has been ran, run main.py. It's syntax is pretty straight forward and will be described upon use.
## About the project

The code is based off of Tech With Tim's password manager python project with some small edits I made myself to add extra functionality and to increase the user experience with better formatting.
