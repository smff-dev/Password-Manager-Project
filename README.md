## Setup
Before anything make sure to run ```pip install cryptography```


To get the password manager ready for use, run initialise.py. This will generate the key for encryption. If you run it more than once it will make any passwords previously entered impossible to decrypt.

Once initialise.py has been ran, run main.py. It's syntax is pretty straight forward and will be described upon use.
